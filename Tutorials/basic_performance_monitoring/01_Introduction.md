# Setting Up a Basic Performance Monitoring Server

## Introduction
The purpose of this tutorial is to help you setup a monitoring server capable of collecting performance data (metrics) from devices in order to assist
with troubleshoting as well as capacity planning.

This is not all that is required of a monitoring server but it's a good start so as to ensure that the connection to devices is working and that it can
